                    <p> The French Open (also known as Roland Garros) is the second of the 4 Grand Slams throughout the year, held every May/June. The tournament and venue are named after the French aviator Roland Garros. It is the premier clay court championship in the world and the only Grand Slam held on this surface. Due to the nature of playing on clay, the French Open is widely regarded as the most physically demanding tennis tournament in the world.
                        Clay courts are considered 'slow' as the tennis balls bounce relatively high and lose much of their speed on contact of the surface, making it more difficult for players to return shots. Movement on clay is also different and more difficult than other surfaces, and play often involves sliding on the loose ground.
